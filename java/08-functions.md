# Java: Functions
We have been using a lot of various functions that exist within Java already but haven't created any of our own, other than using `main()`.

Functions are a useful way of abstracting complexity in our project. Functions will generally require one or more inputs, and then provide a returning result.

*Icecreamary example*

An example: If I am visiting a bespoke icecreamary, I might ask for a double scoop of choc fudge and vanilla on a waffle cone, where as the next customer might ask for a cup of raspberry sorbet. The salesperson calculates the cost for each and advises each custoemr on the price. In order to calculate that cost there are a number of inputs (number of scoops, type of cone, etc) and an output (price). How it is actually calculated does not necessary bother me, provided it works reliably. In this way a function can provide a "black box" model through which to represent our problem. Programmers need to know how to (a) use other peoples abstractions and (b) be able to create their own. For now, the abstraction we are concerned with is creating a function. 


## Functions

Convert the mathematical function `A = Ï€ r^2` to Java:

```java
public static double areaOfCircle( double radius ) {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}
```

*We'll discuss keyword by keyword first. Don't code it yet*

* `public` - is known as an **access modifier**. We'll discuss the role of access modifiers more when we look at classes. There are four access modifiers in Java: *default* (ie: when not explicitly specified), *private*, *protected*, and *public*. To keep things simple while you are learning we will limit ourselves to only using *public* and *private*. See the access modifier section in classes for more information about how these work, for now just make sure you specify it when you create a function.
* `static` - again understanding the function of this keyword will be further explained in the classes section (the presence of this keyword means that the function belongs to the class rather than an object). Again, until we start building classes and objects, have this keyword present when creating a function.
* `double` - this is the data type that the function will return. Functions can provide a value back to the code that calls it, and the function must specify what type of data it will return.
* `areaOfCircle` - finally, this is the name of our function.
* `(double radius)` - immediately following the name of the function is the list of parameter values we will expect to be supplied to the function. In this case, we are expecting one value of type double, which we will refer to internally within the function via the name radius. This name does not have any relation to any variable that may be used outside the function. To accept more than one parameter, we comma separate them.
* `{ .... }` - The code to be executed by our function is enclosed within the braces.
* `return` - This is where we specify the value to be returned to the code that called the function. Once Java encounters a return statement, it will exit the function regardless of any further code you may have written. Your function must provide a return value unless you specify the function datatype as `void` (like we do with main).


## Writing your 1st function

```java
package com.pbaumgarten.basics;
import java.lang.Math;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Functions01 {
    public static double areaOfCircle( double radius ) {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define our variables
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
        double r, answer;
        // Query the user
        System.out.print("Radius: ");
        r = reader.nextDouble();
        // Execute the function we created
        answer = areaOfCircle(r);
        // Print the result
        System.out.println( "The area of this circle is: "+answer );
    }
}
```

## Writing your 2nd function

This next example illustrates two ideas:

* Creating a function that requires two parameters.
* Importing a function we created elsewhere into the current class file. We will reuse our previous `areaOfCircle` function without having to rewrite it. This is one of the coolest reasons to write functions, we can start re-using previous code!

## Writing your 2nd function

```java
package com.pbaumgarten.basics;
import java.lang.Math;
import java.util.Scanner;
import com.pbaumgarten.basics.Functions01;

public class Functions02 {
    public static double areaOfCylinder(double radius, double length) {
        return length * Functions01.areaOfCircle(radius);
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);
        double rad, len, answer;
        System.out.println("Surface area of cylinder calculator");
        System.out.print("Radius: ");
        rad = reader.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Length: ");
        len = reader.nextDouble();
        answer = areaOfCylinder(rad,len);
        System.out.println( "The surface area of this cylinder is: "+answer );
    }
}
```

The power of code re-use should hopefully underscore why it will become important to organise your class files into a well structured package naming scheme. In reality you are not going to want to be importing  `ch.isl.basics.Exercise901` to access a function that calculates the area of a circle, but something like `ch.isl.helpers.Geometry` instead.

## Problem set

1. Test use a few basic geometry functions (similar to above) as you should be quite familiar with those already.
2. Adapt your previous problem sets to use functions.
