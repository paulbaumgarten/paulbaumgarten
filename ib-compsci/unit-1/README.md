# Unit 1: Systems design

<img src="img/sdlc.png" style="float:right">
This unit considers the equivalent of the old MYP Design cycle. At university level for a Computer Science course, the design cycle is known as the SDLC: System development life cycle (some books substitute "system" with "software").

The major sections of the SDLC are:

* Requirements analysis
* Design
* Implementation
* Testing
* Evolution

We will examine each section for what needs to occur.
