# Internal assessment

The Internal Assessment for Computer Science is an opportunity for you to showcase your algorithmic and technical prowess at developing software intended to solve a legitimate, real world problem for someone.

Approximately 30 hours of class time will be devoted to the Internal Assessment. Beyond that it is expected you will contribute at least the same amount of your own time towards the project.

My IA handbook is a thorough 30 page guide through each deliverable, filled with valuable notes from moderators and past experience of things students did well / not so well. Read it carefully...
