# Unit 5: Abstract data structures (HL)

This unit is being taught in conjunction with unit D4: Advanced Object Orientated Programming (HL).

There is considerable overlap between Unit 5 and Unit D4. It makes practical sense to teach the two units together.  Unit 5 is about the theoretical understanding of data structures, their design and pseudo-code implementation. Unit D4 pertains to the Java programming implementation of data structures. 

Unit summary:

* Two dimensional arrays
* Recursion
* Linked lists
* Stacks & queues
* Binary trees

Unit 5 theory will be assessed in the HL extended portion of paper 1, and the Java programming portion will be assessed in the HL portion of paper 2.
