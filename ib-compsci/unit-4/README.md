# Unit 4: Computational thinking, problem solving and programming.

Jeanette Wing (Vice President of Microsoft Research, and previously Presidentâ€™s Processor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh) wrote a short but highly influential paper outlining the importance of computational thinking. That paper forms the basis of this unit within the IB course.

It is available at [https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf )

This is a large unit that will take all of semester 1 of Year 12. The unit is broken into components as follows: 

* Introduction to Java programming skills
* Computational thinking
* Program design using pseudo code, flow charts and trace tables
* Searching & sorting alogorithms
* Algorithm efficiency & Big O
* Programming concepts

## Introduction to Java programming skills

An introduction to programming with Java. Includes:

* Hello world
* Variables & data types
* Numbers & the Math library
* Strings & casting
* Selection
* Repetition
* Functions
* Arrays
* Exceptions
* Files

Each topic contains a problem set that will be submitted via Google Classroom as home learning.
