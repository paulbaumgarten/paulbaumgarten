# iGCSE CompSci - Term3 project

*Demonstrate your programming skill through building a project of your own choosing!.*

You can make a game, a website application, a chat bot, a face recognition alarm system, program a robot or anything else your imagination comes up with! Create a program you want to make!

The idea is that this project will be a mix of demonstrating programminng you already know, combined with teaching yourself something new.

Minimum requirements:

* A graphical user interface. This may be through use of tkinter (windows GUI), pygame (2D video game) or flask (web server), or other option as agreed in advance.
* Persistent data storage using the filesystem. Any valid option is acceptable such as text files, csv, pickle, a database, excel (see pandas), or google sheets.

Academic honesty:

* You may use tutorials / resources you find online provided they are properly cited. (Include the URL of the relevant website as an in-code comment with the relevant code, clearly indicating what it relates to)
* Your programming will be assessed on the sections of code you independently create (so while you can use code from other tutorials, you will only be graded on the code you add/create yourself)
* You are required to make progress uploads every two weeks.

Assessment outline:

<table>
<tr>
    <td>Success criteria<br>(½ lesson)</td>
    <td>Identify between 4 to 7 criteria you will use to self assess the success of your final project. Ie: What do you want to achieve? Use specific measurable technically-correct terms.</td>
    <td>/2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Design<br>(½ lesson)</td>
    <td>Sketch screen wireframe mockups, detailing key functions and flow between screens. See <a href="https://github.com/CMPUT301F13T11/Team11AdventureBook/wiki/User-Interface-Mockup-and-Storyboard" target="_blank">example</a> but only draw a maximum of 4 screens. The idea is to show what the program will look like and how it will behave.</td>
    <td>/3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">You should confirm the viability and suitability of your project idea before proceeding beyond this point</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Creation<br>(8 lessons)</td>
    <td>Code your project. Pay attention to:
<ul>
<li>Suitable and meaningful variable names</li>
<li>Validation of user inputs & error checking as appropriate</li>
<li>Logic is clear and well structured</li>
<li>Outputs, including error messages, are clear</li>
<li>GUI incorporated and functional</li>
<li>Persistent storage / filesystem incorporated and functional</li>
<li>Overall, the project is functional</li></ul>

<tr>
    <td>Demonstration<br>(1 lesson)</td>
    <td>Record a screencast video demonstrating your final project, with particular attention to showcasing each of your success criteria. Maximum 4 minutes.</td>
    <td>/4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Evaluation<br>(1 lesson)</td>
    <td>Critically reflect on your success against each of your original success criteria. Maximum 300 words.</td>

Some project ideas:

* Blog platform website
* Quiz maker
* Networked chat application. To challenge yourself add one or more of the following: 
    * Allowing use of webcam;
    * Sending files, 
    * Different chat rooms
* Graph / chart maker (see matplotlib)
* PDF generator (see pyfpdf): Create your own “mail merge to PDF” tool that reads in a text from a file or spreadsheet, maybe adds images as well, and generate a PDF file
* Simple image editor (see Pillow): Your own simple version of Photoshop ??
* Face detection & recognition with OpenCV. Create a Raspberry Pi security system?
* Telegram bot/integration, send and receive messages?
* Cozmo robot project?
* Video game: Some options [here](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/) (remember the rules about citing)
