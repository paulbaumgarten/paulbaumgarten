# Unit 1 programming

## Get setup

We will be learning the Python programming language.

Firstly, pleases complete the instructions in my handout to setup:

* Pycharm
* Github account signup
* Github Desktop

Alternatively, use one of the online Python editors such as [https://repl.it](https://repl.it) or [https://trinket.io](https://trinket.io). These will allow you to try it out without installing anything on your computer.

## Your first program

The traditional starting point for learning a programming language.

```python
# display the text Hello world! to screen
print("Hello world!")
```

Note: In Python the `#` is used to donote a comment follows.

## Learning Python

Rather than reproducing all my Learning Python notes (and risk updates causing one set of documents to fall out of sync),  we will work through my existing Python notes repository

* [https://pbaumgarten.com/python](https://pbaumgarten.com/python)

You should complete all the 100-series tutorials and problem sets.

## Unit assessment

* You will be assessed on the problem sets for each of the Learning Python topics in two submissions.

   * Initial submission for formative review & feedback (review targets provided)
   * Final submission for reporting (ARR) purposes

* There will be a written test for reporting (ARR) purposes.

   * Paper & pen in-class written test
   * No computer, no notes, no calculator
   * The test will be based on the problem sets, the questions being very similar to them.
