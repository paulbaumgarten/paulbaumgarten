# Unit 3: Data and logic

* 1.1.1 Binary systems
* 1.1.2 Hexadecimal 
* 1.3.1 Logic gates

## Syllabus

Candidates should be able to:

* recognise the use of binary numbers in computer systems
* convert positive denary integers into binary and positive binary integers into denary (a maximum of 16 bits will be used)
* show understanding of the concept of a byte and how the byte is used to measure memory size
* use binary in computer registers for a given application (such as in robotics, digital instruments and counting systems)

Candidates should be able to:

* represent positive numbers in hexadecimal notation
* show understanding of the reasons for choosing hexadecimal notation to represent numbers
* convert positive hexadecimal integers to and from denary (a maximum of four hexadecimal digits will be required)
* convert positive hexadecimal integers to and from binary (a maximum of 16 bit binary numbers will be required)
* represent numbers stored in registers and main memory as hexadecimal
* identify current uses of hexadecimal numbers in computing, such as defining colours in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, assembly languages and machine code, debugging

Candidates should be able to:

* use logic gates to create electronic circuits
* understand and define the functions of NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR and XOR (EOR) gates, including the binary output produced from all the possible binary inputs (all gates, except the NOT gate, will have 2 inputs only)
* draw truth tables and recognise a logic gate from its truth table
* recognise and use the standard symbols used to represent logic gates: NOT AND OR NAND
* produce truth tables for given logic circuits:
* produce a logic circuit to solve a given problem or to implement a given written logic statement
