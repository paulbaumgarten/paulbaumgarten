# Unit 2 Algorithms



* 2.1.1 Problem solving & design
* 2.1.2 Pseudocode & flowcharts
* 1.5 Ethics

## Syllabus

Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding that every computer system is made up of sub-systems, which in turn are made up of further sub-systems
* use top-down design, structure diagrams, flowcharts, pseudocode, library routines and sub-routines
* work out the purpose of a given algorithm
* explain standard methods of solution
* suggest and apply suitable test data
* understand the need for validation and verification checks to be made on input data (validation could include range checks, length checks, type checks and check digits)
* use trace tables to find the value of variables at each step in an algorithm
* identify errors in given algorithms and suggest ways of removing these errors
* produce an algorithm for a given problem (either in the form of pseudocode or flowchart)
* comment on the effectiveness of a given solution
* understand and use pseudocode for assignment, using ←
* understand and use pseudocode, using the following conditional statements:
    * IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF
    * CASE ... OF ... OTHERWISE ... ENDCASE
* understand and use pseudocode, using the following loop structures: 
    * FOR ... TO ... NEXT
    * REPEAT ... UNTIL
    * WHILE ... DO ... ENDWHILE
* understand and use pseudocode, using the following commands and statements: INPUT and OUTPUT (e.g. READ and PRINT)
    * totalling (e.g. Sum ← Sum + Number)
    * counting (e.g. Count ← Count + 1)
* understand and use standard flowchart symbols to represent the above statements, commands and structures

(Candidates are advised to try out solutions to a variety of different problems on a computer using a language of their choice; no particular programming language will be assumed in this syllabus.)

Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of computer ethics, including copyright issues and plagiarism
* distinguish between free software, freeware and shareware
* show understanding of the ethical issues raised by the spread of electronic communication and computer systems, including hacking, cracking and production of malware

## Computational thinking

Computational thinking is what allows us to go from the quick and simple little programs we've been writing, to solving more meaningful problems.

There are commonly four thinking skills associated with this.

1. Decomposition - Can I divide this into sub-problems?
2. Pattern recognition - Can I find repeating patterns?
3. Abstraction - Can generalise this to make an overall rule?
4. Algorithm design - Can I document the programming steps for any of this?

For a walk through on using these thinking skills, make use of:

* My [introductory video on Computational thinking](https://youtu.be/2bvt6PCBVPo)
* My [introductory slides on Computational thinking](unit-2-computational-thinking-slides.pdf)

Some other general advice I would give to new programmers is:

* Just start - A blank screen can be overwhelming
* Don’t start at the start - Programs are not novels, you read and write a program by jumping around
* Start with something you know - Build the user interface and work back from there
* Don’t be afraid to Google - Prioritise results from forums such as stackoverflow
* Test & print a lot

Once you've digested the slides or video, have a go at a couple of problems of your own:

* Problem 1: Create an age calculator. Prompting the user for (1) their birthdate and (2) the current date, calculate their age.

* Problem 2: Create a money change calculator. Given a set of possible coins available to the shop attendant, and an amount of change they must provide the customer, calculate how many of each coin they should give the customer. For example if a country has 1cent, 5cent, 10cent, & 50cent coins and you need to provide 67cents of change, the clerk would give 1x50cent, 1x10cent, 1x5cent, and 2x1cent coins. 

## Problem solving and design

## Algorithm (9.2)

## Testing (9.3)

## Validation & verification (9.4)

## Trace tables (9.5)

## Pseudo code and flow charts

A note about pseudo code: What it is supposed to be vs what it is in the iGCSE course.

"Any pseudocode presented by candidates will only be assessed for the logic of the solution presented – where the logic is understood by the Examiner, and correctly solves the problem addressed, the candidate will be given credit regardless of whether the candidate has followed the style presented here. Using a recommended style will, however, enable the candidate to communicate their solution to the Examiner more effectively."
