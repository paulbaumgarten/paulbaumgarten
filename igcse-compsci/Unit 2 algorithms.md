# Unit 2 Algorithms

* 2.1.1 Problem solving & design
* 2.1.2 Pseudocode & flowcharts
* 1.5 Ethics

## Syllabus

Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding that every computer system is made up of sub-systems, which in turn are made up of further sub-systems
* use top-down design, structure diagrams, flowcharts, pseudocode, library routines and sub-routines
* work out the purpose of a given algorithm
* explain standard methods of solution
* suggest and apply suitable test data
* understand the need for validation and verification checks to be made on input data (validation could include range checks, length checks, type checks and check digits)
* use trace tables to find the value of variables at each step in an algorithm
* identify errors in given algorithms and suggest ways of removing these errors
* produce an algorithm for a given problem (either in the form of pseudocode or flowchart)
* comment on the effectiveness of a given solution
* understand and use pseudocode for assignment, using ←
* understand and use pseudocode, using the following conditional statements:
    * IF ... THEN ... ELSE ... ENDIF
    * CASE ... OF ... OTHERWISE ... ENDCASE
* understand and use pseudocode, using the following loop structures: 
    * FOR ... TO ... NEXT
    * REPEAT ... UNTIL
    * WHILE ... DO ... ENDWHILE
* understand and use pseudocode, using the following commands and statements: INPUT and OUTPUT (e.g. READ and PRINT)
    * totalling (e.g. Sum ← Sum + Number)
    * counting (e.g. Count ← Count + 1)
* understand and use standard flowchart symbols to represent the above statements, commands and structures

(Candidates are advised to try out solutions to a variety of different problems on a computer using a language of their choice; no particular programming language will be assumed in this syllabus.)


Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of computer ethics, including copyright issues and plagiarism
* distinguish between free software, freeware and shareware
* show understanding of the ethical issues raised by the spread of electronic communication and computer systems, including hacking, cracking and production of malware
