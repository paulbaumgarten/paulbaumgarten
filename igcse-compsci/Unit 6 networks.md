1.2.1 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of what is meant by transmission of data
* distinguish between serial and parallel data transmission
* distinguish between simplex, duplex and half-duplex data transmission
* show understanding of the reasons for choosing serial or parallel data transmission
* show understanding of the need to check for errors
* explain how parity bits are used for error detection
* show understanding of the use of serial and parallel data transmission, in Universal Serial Bus (USB) and Integrated Circuit (IC)

1.2.2 Candidates should be able to (links to 1.4):

* show understanding of the security aspects of using the Internet and understand what methods are available to help minimise the risks
* show understanding of the Internet risks associated with malware, including viruses, spyware and hacking
* explain how anti-virus and other protection software helps to protect the user from security risks

1.2.3 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of the role of the browser
* show understanding of the role of an Internet Service Provider (ISP)
* show understanding of what is meant by hypertext transfer protocol (http and https) and HTML

1.4 Candidates should be able to:

* 1.4.1a show understanding of the need to keep data safe from accidental damage, including corruption and human errors
* 1.4.1b show understanding of the need to keep data safe from malicious actions, including unauthorised viewing, deleting, copying and corruption
* 1.4.2 show understanding of how data are kept safe when stored and transmitted, including:
    * use of passwords, both entered at a keyboard and biometric
    * use of firewalls, both software and hardware, including proxy servers
    * use of security protocols such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    * use of symmetric encryption (plain text, cypher text and use of a key) showing understanding that increasing the length of a key increases the strength of the encryption
* 1.4.3 show understanding of the need to keep online systems safe from attacks including denial of service attacks, phishing, pharming
* 1.4.4 describe how the knowledge from 1.4.1, 1.4.2 and 1.4.3 can be applied to real-life scenarios including, for example, online banking, shopping

1.5 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of computer ethics, including copyright issues and plagiarism
* distinguish between free software, freeware and shareware
* show understanding of the ethical issues raised by the spread of electronic communication and computer systems, including hacking, cracking and production of malware
