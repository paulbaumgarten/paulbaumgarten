## Syllabus

1.1.3 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding that sound (music), pictures, video, text and numbers are stored in different formats
* identify and describe methods of error detection and correction, such as parity checks, check digits, checksums and Automatic Repeat reQuests (ARQ)
* show understanding of the concept of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) files, JPEG files, MP3 and MP4 files
* show understanding of the principles of data compression (lossless and lossy) applied to music/video, photos and text files

1.3.2 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of the basic Von Neumann model for a computer system and the stored program concept (program instructions and data are stored in main memory and instructions are fetched and executed one after another)
* describe the stages of the fetch-execute cycle, including the use of registers and buses

1.3.3 Candidates should be able to:

* describe the principles of operation (how each device works) of these input devices: 2D and 3D scanners, barcode readers, Quick Response (QR) code readers, digital cameras, keyboards, mice, touch screens, interactive whiteboards, microphones
* describe how these principles are applied to real-life scenarios, for example: scanning of passports at airports, barcode readers at supermarket checkouts, and touch screens on mobile devices
* describe how a range of sensors can be used to input data into a computer system, including light, temperature, magnetic field, gas, pressure, moisture, humidity, pH and motion
* describe how these sensors are used in real-life scenarios, for example: street lights, security devices, pollution control, games, and household and industrial applications

1.3.4 Candidates should be able to:

* describe the principles of operation of the following output devices: inkjet, laser and 3D printers; 2D and 3D cutters; speakers and headphones; actuators; flat-panel display screens, such as Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) display; LCD projectors and Digital Light Projectors (DLP)
* describe how these principles are applied to real-life scenarios, for example: printing single items on demand or in large volumes; use of small screens on mobile devices

1.3.5 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of the difference between: primary, secondary and off-line storage and provide examples of each, such as:
primary: Read Only Memory (ROM) and Random Access Memory (RAM) secondary: hard disk drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD);
off-line: Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), Compact Disc (CD), Blu-ray disc, USB flash memory and removable HDD
* describe the principles of operation of a range of types of storage device and media including magnetic, optical and solid state
* describe how these principles are applied to currently available storage solutions, such as SSDs, HDDs, USB flash memory, DVDs, CDs and Blu-ray discs
* calculate the storage requirement of a file

1.3.6 Candidates should be able to:

* describe the purpose of an operating system (Candidates will be required to understand the purpose and function of an operating system and why it is needed. They will not be required to understand how operating systems work.)
* show understanding of the need for interrupts

1.3.7 Candidates should be able to:

* show understanding of the need for both high-level and low-level languages
* show understanding of the need for compilers when translating programs written in a high-level language
* show understanding of the use of interpreters with high-level language programs
* show understanding of the need for assemblers when translating programs written in assembly language
