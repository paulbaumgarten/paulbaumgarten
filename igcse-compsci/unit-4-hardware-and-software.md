## Computer architecture and the fetch-execute cycle (1.3.2)

"A computer processor does moronically simple things — it moves a byte from memory to register, adds a byte to another byte, moves the result back to memory. The only reason anything substantial gets completed is that these operations occur very quickly. To quote Robert Noyce, ‘After you become reconciled to the nanosecond, computer operations are conceptually fairly simple.’” [*](Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software by Charles Petzold)

* Watch [Tom Scott's exellcent explainer into the Fetch-decode-execute cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5JC9Ve1sfI) (9:03m).
* Do some basic assembler to understand the architecture better?

## Input devices (1.3.3)

GPIO

* describe the principles of operation (how each device works) of these input devices: 2D and 3D scanners, barcode readers, Quick Response (QR) code readers, digital cameras, keyboards, mice, touch screens, interactive whiteboards, microphones
*  describe how these principles are applied to real-life scenarios, for example: scanning of passports at airports, barcode readers at supermarket checkouts, and touch screens on mobile devices
* describe how a range of sensors can be used to input data into a computer system, including light, temperature, magnetic field, gas, pressure, moisture, humidity, pH and motion
* describe how these sensors are used in real-life scenarios, for example: street lights, security devices, pollution control, games, and household and industrial applications

## Output devices (1.3.4)

* describe the principles of operation of the following output devices: inkjet, laser and 3D printers; 2D and 3D cutters; speakers and headphones; actuators; flat-panel display screens, such as Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and Light-Emitting Diodes (LED) display; LCD projectors and Digital Light Projectors (DLP)
* describe how these principles are applied to real-life scenarios, for example: printing single items on demand or in large volumes; use of small screens on mobile devices


## Memory, storage devices and media (1.3.5)

* show understanding of the difference between: primary, secondary and off-line storage and provide examples of each, such as: primary: Read Only Memory (ROM) and Random Access Memory (RAM) secondary: hard disk drive (HDD) and Solid State Drive (SSD); off-line: Digital Versatile Disc (DVD), Compact Disc (CD), Blu-ray disc, USB flash memory and removable
HDD
* describe the principles of operation of a range of types of storage device and media including magnetic, optical and solid state
* describe how these principles are applied to currently available storage solutions, such as SSDs, HDDs, USB flash memory, DVDs, CDs and Blu-ray discs
* calculate the storage requirement of a file

## Operating systems (1.3.6)

purpose; need for interrupts

## High and low-level languages and their translators (1.3.7)

* high and low level languages
* compilers, interpreters, assemblers
* pi tiein - assemblier, c, c++, python, java
