# Github Desktop walkthrough

## Step 1. Create your Github account

1. Visit https://github.com/ 
2. Click "Sign up"
3. Enter a username, email and password. 
4. Verify you are human, click "Create account"
5. "Choose your subscription" = Free
6. "What is your level of programming experience" and "What do you plan to use Github for" you can click "skip this step" at the bottom
7. Please verify your email address – open your email, click on the link provided in the email you will have received from Github.
8. When the "create a new repository" screen appears you are done. Don’t create a repository through the online site.

## Step 2. Create your project repository

The first time you open GitHub Desktop, it will require you to sign in

1. "Sign in to Github.com"
2. Enter your username or email, and password, click "Sign in"
3. "Configure Git" screen, enter your name and email, click "Continue"
4. "Make Github Desktop better" – Up to you, but I turn off the "submit periodic usage stats". Click Finish.

Once you are signed in

1. "Let’s get started".
2. Click "Create a new repository on your hard drive" (note: a repository is slightly different to a project folder. It is a project folder, but it also contains additional Git data). It does not matter if you have an existing project folder you wish to turn into a repository, or if you have not started your project yet and wish to create an empty working space.
 
Now continue working on your project until you are ready to upload.

## Step 3. Upload your project repository to Github.com

If your project is being uploaded for the first time

1. Click "Publish repository" for a pop up screen to appear.
2. You can keep "Keep this code private" set to on.
3. Click "Publish repository" on the pop up screen.
 
## Step 4. Upload project updates to Github.com

If you need to update the online copy of your project

1. Open Github Desktop, and select the relevant repository.
2. You will be presented a list of files that have changed. You may review the changes.
3. You must enter a summary. While getting used to Github, you can keep it simple (eg: "changed files"). Ideally you will be adding a meaningful description of what has changed, so browsing through the history of your project becomes easier later.
4. Click "Commit to master" to confirm the changes.
5. Click "Push origin" to actually perform the upload.
 
## Share project with me

1. Go to [https://github.com/](github.com), login, go to **Your repositories**, & open the relevant repository.
2. Click Settings
3. Click Collaborators. Enter "paulbaumgarten" as a collaborator, click "Add collaborator".
