## What is a variable?

A named location in the computerâ€™s memory that you can use to store a value to and read values from.

## Numeric variables and addition

```python
from microbit import *

n = 0
while True:
    n = n + 1
    display.scroll(n)
```

* What will the above do?
* How can we use the buttons to add/subject 1 to the number?

## Addition and subtraction

```python
from microbit import *

n = 0
while n < 100:
    n = n + 1
    if button_a.was_pressed():
        n = n + 1
    if button_b.was_pressed():
        n = n - 1
    display.scroll(n)
```

* How can we use pin0 to double the number and pin1 to halve the number?

## Multiplication and division

```python
from microbit import *

n = 0
while n < 100:
    n = n + 1
    if button_a.was_pressed():
        n = n + 1
    if button_b.was_pressed():
        n = n - 1
    if pin0.is_touched():
        n = n * 2
    if pin1.is_touched():
        n = n / 2
    display.scroll(n)
```

## Using a random number generator

Firstly import the `random` library as it is not part of default Python.

```python
import random
```

Then inside your main loop, add...

```python
    if pin2.is_touched():
        n = random.randint(0,99)
```

## Modulus

Not in the video, but a useful thing for programmers to know about: The modulus. Effectively it is "the remainder" from a divison. For instance, if calculated 14 divided by 5, the answer would be 2 with 4 left over as remainder. In Python we can do this in two steps. To perform the division with the whole number of 5s that would go into 14, it would be `14 // 5` to return `2`, and to find out the remainder that would look like `14 % 5` which would return a value of `4`. 

```python
from microbit import *

n = 0
while True:
    if button_a.was_pressed():
        n = n + 1
    if button_b.was_pressed():
        n = n - 1
    column = n % 5
    row = n // 5
    display.clear()
    display.set_pixel(column, row, 9)
```
