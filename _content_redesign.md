Multi choice or quick answer question

## Reading code

What will output?

a = 5
a = 7
print(a)

What will output?

a = 3
b = a * 5
print(a, b)

What will output?

a = 4
a = a * 5
print(a)

What will output?

a = 123
b = a // 10
c = a % 10
print(b, c)

What will output?

a = 2
if a > 2:
    print("a")
print("b")

What will output?

a = 2
if a >= 2:
    print("a")
print("b")

What will output?

a = 13
if a % 2 == 0:
    print("a")
else:
    print("b")

What will never print?

if a % 2 == 0:
    print("a")
elif a % 2 == 1:
    print("b")
elif a % 2 == 2:
    print("c")
else:
    print("d")
