# Machine Learning notes

> Work in progress

## Understanding a neural network

* Insert walk through of one iteration

## Build your own Artifical neural network

* Creating a nn in Python without any libraries

* Demos using XOR, AND, OR, bit adder etc

## Introducing Tensorflow2

* What is tensorflow

* Why use tensorflow instead of our own class

* Reproducing the XOR gate with TF2

* MNIST handwriting recognition

* Some other use example?

## Reinforcement learning

* How it works

* gym?
