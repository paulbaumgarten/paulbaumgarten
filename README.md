## About me

I am a Secondary Computer Science teacher currently at Sha Tin College in the incredible city of Hong Kong. Previously I taught International Baccalaureate at the International School of Lausanne (Switzerland) from 2015 to 2019. Before that I was previously based in Perth, Western Australia where I was raised. I have been teaching since 2006, prior to which I worked as an IT Manager and freelance programmer for a number of years.

As a Computer Scientist, I like to keep current with industry and generally either have a programming project running on the side or am in the search for one. I consider myself a full stack developer with my current preferred tools being Python and Javascript with HTML5 and SQL technologies. Past commercial projects have used PHP and C# .NET. I'm also proficient in using Java, Node.js, Processing, and Arduino C amongst other technologies.

The primary purpose of my website is as a curriculum resource for the students I teach. I also use it as hosting space for various side projects that require an online presence.

Whether you are here because you have to be (ie: a student of mine), or are just looking to develop your Computer Science or programming skills, I wish you well on your journey! Computer Science is a fascinating industry of unending change and learning. There are so many exciting technologies emerging at the moment, it is a great time to learn CS!
