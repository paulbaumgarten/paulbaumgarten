## Intro to HTML

Javascript rarely stands alone in isolation. As the langauge of the web, it is very commonly used in conjunction with HTML and CSS, so an understanding of these two markup languages is very useful.

* [Introduction to HTML](html.html)
* [Anchor elements](html.html)
* [The DIV and SPAN elements](html.html)
* [IMG, VIDEO, AUDIO elements](html.html)
* [FORM and INPUT elements](html.html)
* [Lists](html.html)
* [Tables](html.html)

## Intro to CSS

Javascript rarely stands alone in isolation. As the langauge of the web, it is very commonly used in conjunction with HTML and CSS, so an understanding of these two markup languages is very useful.

* [Introduction](css.html)
* [Boiler plate](css.html)
* [Basic styling](css.html)
* [Showing/hiding items](css.html)
* [Grid layout](css.html)
* [Drop down menus](css.html)
* [Styling form elements](css.html)
* [Icons](css.html)
* [Styling tables](css.html)

## Javascript & the DOM

The DOM (document object model) forms the basis of where Javascript, HTML and CSS all intersect. 

* [Document object model functions & properties](dom.html)
* [Event handlers](dom.html#event-handlers)
* [Basic form tasks](dom.html#basic-form-tasks) (validation, send)
* [Uploading files](dom.html#uploading-files)
* [Local storage](dom.html#local-storage)
* [Reading an uploaded file in the browser](javascript-read-uploaded-file-in-broswer.html)
* [Geolocation](javascript-geolocation.html)
* [Detect screen size, device type](javascript-detect-device.html)
* [Cordova](javascript-cordova.html)

## Node.js

Javascript doesn't just have to run in the browser. Node.js is when Javascript is used to run as a standalone tool, commonly to create web servers.

* [Install & setup of Node.js](nodejs.html) (including npm) *coming soon*
* [A simple express.js web server](nodejs.html#expressjs) *coming soon*

## Firebase

Google Firebase is one of a number of tools that Google makes available for developers. It is quite handy as a "proof of concept" tool that minimises the need for you to create your own "back end" server.

Firebase can be used to provide:

* Authentication of users against their pre-existing Google credentials.
* Store/retrieve application data in JSON format
* Upload/download files for storage

Tutorials and notes on Firebase as follows:

* Part 1 - [Firebase authentication](firebase.html#firebase-authentication)
* Part 2 - [Firebase database](firebase.html#firebase-database)
* Part 3 - [Firebase file storage](firebase.html#firebase-file-storage)

## HTML Canvas

The HTML canvas is a graphics system that you can program with Javascript. The element is divided into pixels. You use sets of pixel coordinates to tell Javascript where to draw shapes, place text or images etc.

* [Coordinate system](canvas.html)
* [Hello canvas!](canvas.html#hello-canvas)
* [Drawing basic shapes](canvas.html#drawing-basic-shapes)
* [Using colour](canvas.html#using-color)
* [Displaying text](canvas.html#displaying-text)
* [Keyboard events](canvas.html#keyboard-events)
* [Mouse events](canvas.html#mouse-events)
* [Drawing an image](canvas.html#drawing-an-image)
* [Playing a sound](canvas.html#playing-a-sound)
* [Detecting collisions](canvas.html#detecting-collisions)
