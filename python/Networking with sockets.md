# Socket - Network communication

Read and write over network sockets!

Sockets are the technical term to describe the process of programs talking over a network connection.

Network communications are based on the "client-server" model. 

* The role of the "server" program is to listen for programs wanting to communicate with it, listen to what they have to say and to then send a reply. 
* The role of the "client" program is to initiate communication with a server, send a message and listen for the reply.

This means you will need two programs running to get this to work. Even better if you can run them on different computers and actually get them to communicate over a network! (but it will work just fine running both programs on the same computer)

* If you do use separate computers, you will need to know the network IP address of the "server" computer.  You will then have to send the correct IP address in the second parameter of the send_message_get_reply function of the client so it knows where to initiate the conversation.

I've deliberately made the client program work so the one function call is all that is required to talk to a server. This should make it a lot easier to incorporate into a project.

Some possible uses:

* Create a chat server
* Live multiplayer games!
* What ever your imagination can conjure!

## Exericse 1 - Simple chat server

Note: This will only function properly where two computers can see each other on the same network (eg: peer-to-peer). For instance, this won't work between two people at different addresses each running off their own ISP internet connection unless you know how to set up Network Address Translation port forwarding.

            else:

    # Connect, send, close

Using the above class file, it is now as simple as this to run a network application from your main:

```python
### File: main.py
import basicnetworking

def receive_message(addr, msg):
    # This function will be automatically run every time a message is received. This is where I code how I want my program to respond to a message.
    print("Message from {}: {}".format(addr,msg))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Your IP address is: " + basicnetworking.get_my_ipaddress())
    my_port = int(input("What port number would you like to receive messages on? (between 1024 and 65535) "))
    client_addr = input("What's the other computer's IP address?")
    client_port = int(input("What's the other computer's port?"))

    # Start my server
    server = basicnetworking.BasicServer(receive_message, my_port)
    server.start()

    # Run the program
    print("Write your messages. [ENTER] to send, or an empty line to quit.")
    msg = input()
    while msg != "":
        # To send a message over the network is now just this one line of code.
        basicnetworking.send(msg, client_addr, client_port)
        msg = input()

    server.stop()
    print("Goodbye...")

```
