# Quick Python recap

This recap is targetted for middle school students who have done a little Python (such as with the Microbit) and need a recap before moving on to one of my other Python units.

The focus is on giving you a quick recap on the essentials such as:

1. [Variables and numbers](/python/101-variables-and-numbers)
2. [Strings and casting](/python/102-strings-and-casting)
3. [Truth, if, else and while](/python/103-truth-if-else-while)
4. [Lists and for-loops](/python/104-lists-for)
5. [Functions](/python/105-functions)

## Recap reference notes

A recommend printing and keeping a copy of my [Python basics reference for beginners PDF](../python/000-python-basics-reference.pdf). No programmer is ever expected to have everything memorised, so having a useful guide to serve as a reminder prompt of the basics can be enormously helpful.
