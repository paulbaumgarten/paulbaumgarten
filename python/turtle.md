# Learn Python Turtle

The turtle introduction is intended to suit for younger students who are opting-in to embrace a programming environment more challenging than Scratch but are a little intimidated by the idea of coding in a pure text environment. The turtle allows you to learn the basics through a graphical/visual system where you draw and animate various shapes on screen. 

Use either of the following tools:

* Download and install the [Python IDLE editor](https://python.org/), or 
* Use Python online with [Repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/python_turtle)

# Lessons

Lesson 1, 2 and 3 will teach you how to use turtle to draw on your screen.

* Download [lessons 1, 2 and 3](turtle-lessons-1-2-3.pdf)

Lesson 4 will teach you how to use mouse clicks to control where your turtle goes.

Lesson 5 will teach you how to have two turtles on screen, one chasing the other.

Lesson 6 will add a timing feature to our lesson 5 game. How long can you keep the turtle from getting caught?

Lesson 7 will finish with a mini project challenge.
