# Kivy

Kivy is a multi-platform GUI framework for Python.

From the docs, *"Kivy runs on Linux, Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and Raspberry Pi. You can run the same code on all supported platforms."*

In other words, Kivy holds the promise of facilitating using Python to create mobile apps for iOS and Android.

Be warned, the default tutorials on [kivy.org](https://kivy.org) are not at all helpful. 

Fortunately, the people at RealPython have written a much better tutorial. Have a go at learning Kivy at [realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/](https://realpython.com/mobile-app-kivy-python/).

More updates after I have the opportunity to try it out myself ;-)
