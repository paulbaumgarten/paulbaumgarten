# Learning Python notes

<img src="img/python-logo.png" style="float:right">

This represents my extensive and continually growing set of notes for learning the Python programming language. I use these notes extensively with my students and they are frequently updated. I welcome your feedback or suggestions on how they may be improved.

Supplemental to these notes, I have a range of Python videos on Youtube at [https://youtube.com/pbaumgarten](https://youtube.com/pbaumgarten).

## Get Python

Download and install Python from `https://python.org`. Run IDLE on your computer (recommended). Open your Windows Start menu, scroll down to "P", and open the Python sub menu, select the program called "IDLE" â€“ make sure the version of Python starts with a 3.

Alternatively, use one of the online Python editors such as [https://repl.it](https://repl.it) or [https://trinket.io](https://trinket.io). These will allow you to try it out without installing anything on your computer.

## The basics

This is the place to start if you are brand new to Python. I have introdutory videos, extensive review notes and practice problem sets to assist you on your programming journey.
