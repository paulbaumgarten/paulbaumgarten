# Learn Python

<img src="img/python-logo.png" style="float:right">

This represents my extensive and continually growing set of notes for learning the Python programming language. I use these notes extensively with my students and they are frequently updated. I welcome your feedback or suggestions on how they may be improved.

Supplemental to these notes, I have a range of [Python videos on Youtube](videos.md).

## Get Python

Download and install Python from `https://python.org`. Run IDLE on your computer (recommended). Open your Windows Start menu, scroll down to "P", and open the Python sub menu, select the program called "IDLE" â€“ make sure the version of Python starts with a 3.

Alternatively, use one of the online Python editors such as [https://repl.it](https://repl.it) or [https://trinket.io](https://trinket.io). These will allow you to try it out without installing anything on your computer.

## The basics

This is the place to start if you are brand new to Python. I have introdutory videos, extensive review notes and practice problem sets to assist you on your programming journey. 

1. [Variables and numbers](101-variables-and-numbers.md)
2. [Strings and casting](102-strings-and-casting.md)
3. [Truth, if, else and while](103-truth-if-else-while.md)
4. [Lists and for-loops](104-lists-for.md)
5. [Functions](105-functions.md)
6. [Files](106-files.md)
7. [Exceptions](107-exceptions.md)
8. [Dates and times](108-dates-times.md)
9. [Dictionaries](109-dictionaries.md)

After you have completed the lessons, feel free to make use of my [Python basics reference for beginners PDF](000-python-basics-reference.pdf) that serves as a summary of the above topics.
